## Notes for Success
- Always **define requirements and constraints** first — don’t jump into coding.
- Discuss **scalability** — how will it perform for millions of users or data points?
- Cover **performance optimization techniques** relevant to the use case.
- Address **accessibility (a11y)** and **internationalization (i18n)** considerations.
- Think about **maintainability** — folder structure, separation of concerns.
- Explain **trade-offs** of different approaches.
