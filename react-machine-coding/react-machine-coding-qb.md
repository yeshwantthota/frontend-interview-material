## Notes for Success
- Break down UI into **small reusable components**.
- Use **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`** for performance-heavy lists or computations.
- Prioritize **accessibility (a11y)** — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation.
- Keep state minimal and **derive UI from state** rather than storing everything.
- Write clean, modular, and **testable** code.
